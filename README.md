# Python Projects
This repository contains implementations of several machine learning techniques that the building blocks of data science.
\
\
**Classification:** Contains a dendrogram as well as an evaluation of three classification techniques used to analyse weather data: support vector machines, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbours.
\
\
**Decision Tree:** Contains a Gini calculator as well as a decision tree fully implemented using no imported libraries.
\
\
**Logistic Regression:** Contains a simple implementation of a binary logistic regression classifier with two features.
\
\
**Natural Language Processing:** Contains two methods to classify between three languages. These methods are further investigated with and without diacritic marks present in the data.
\
\
**Priority Queue:** Contains an implementation of a priority queue that accepts inserts with an accompanying priority which is used in determining the order of removal.
