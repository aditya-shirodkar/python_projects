# Python Projects
\
This repository contains implementations of several machine learning techniques.
\
**Classification:** Contains a dendrogram as well as three classification techniques used to analyse weather data: support vector machines, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbours.
\
**Decision Tree:** Contains a gini calculator as well as a decision tree fully implemented using no imported libraries, to be used on iris data.
\
**Logistic Regression:** Contains a simple implementation of a binary logistic regression classifier with two features.
\
**Natural Language Processing:** Contains two methods to classify between three languages. Furthermore, these methods are investigated with and without the impact of diacritics.
\
**Priority Queue:** Contains an implementation of a priority queue that accepts inserts with an accompanying priority which is then used in determining the order of removal.
